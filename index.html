	<!-- TOO MUCH SPACE AT THE TOP!!! maybe put an animation, other image there? make my name bigger? nah.  move menu and make it horizontal? also, there's an optical illusion in the bright top part. making the text look like it's ascending from left to right,, might want to move everything onto the left side... maybe do something funky to the scrolling, do i want the backgruond static or moveable, NEED TO MAKE IT DISPLAY WELL ON NON MAXIMIZED BROWSER
	Maybe center the header?? to see both extremes of the cool picture
